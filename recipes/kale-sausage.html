<!--A description of this dish-->

<p>I owe a bit of credit to my ex. She broke my heart years ago, but did leave me with this recipe I use about weekly. It's healthy, it's hearty and comforting, and it can use the entire bag of kale you got that if you didn't,
would almost certainly go bad, I know how it is. It's got your greens, it's got sausage for protein, you can add a grain if you want but it stands strong on its own too.
Add some lemon and parm on top for that zest and added comfort. This is another dish that can last you a couple subsequent meals during the week, who doesn't love three meals for the cooking effort of one? Weirdos, that's who.

<h2>Ingredients</h2>
<ul>
    <li>A bag of kale</li>
    <li>Half a white or yellow onion</li>
    <li>Olive oil, liberal amount</li>
    <li>Sausage of your choice, about 4 links, chopped</li>
    <li><em>OPTIONAL:</em> Rice or quinoa</li>
    <li>Some lemon wedges for that juice</li>
    <li>Sprinkling parmesan</li>
    <li>S&P, no not the market index</li>
</ul>

<h2>Steps</h2>
<ol>
    <li>Chop the sausage into discs.
        Heat the oil and throw the sausage in the pan.
        Turn until golden brown, about 5 minutes if it's already pre-cooked.
    </li>
    <li>Put them in a bowl to the side once done cooking.</li>
    <li>In the same pan, which should be greased up, throw your chopped onion in there with some more olive oil, cook low and slow to caramelize, about 5 minutes.</li>
    <li>Once brown, throw that kale in there, first bunch. 
        Throw some S&P and olive oil on top. 
        Mix around to get the pieces their time at the bottom of the pan.
        <strong><em>PRO TIP:</em></strong>cover the pan with a tight-fitting lid and let the moisture wilt them a bit.
    </li>
    <li>Once cooked, add the sausage back into the pan with the kale and mix around.</li>
    <li>Squeeze that lemon on top, sprinkle some parmesan cheese.</li>
    <li>Mangia!</li>
</ol>
