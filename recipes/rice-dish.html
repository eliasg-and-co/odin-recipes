    <!--HTML description of rice dish-->

    <p>
        <strong>Rice Dish</strong> is what I call it. I think it's actually referred to as <em>Creamy Chicken and Rice</em> but I've had it
        so many times that I called it my own thing. It's the recipe I would request as my first meal home from college each
        semester, it's the most comfort-food meal that my mom has made me, and it remains one of my favorite dishes well into adulthood.
    </p>
    <p>
        It's one pot, so all you people that hat doing dishes can rejoice, just don't let it soak too long or that cheese is going to stick.
        You can substitute things, but don't skimp on the cheese or the wine, <em>for cooking</em>. This meal will also last you the rest of the week
        if you pace yourself, which is hard with something this comforting and frankly not that healthy. Enjoy, or else!!!
    </p>
    <p>
        Don't you <strong>hate</strong> when recipe pages are like novels, so damn long with their stories and alternative recipe choices and whatever else
        as a means to make the most space for ads? Not this one, brutalist recipe page!

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1/4 cup of Olive Oil</li>
        <li>4 tbsp butter</li>
        <li>1 medium onion, white or yellow. If you go red you're a sicko</li>
        <li>2 large carrots, but you can use baby too</li>    
        <li>1.5 pounds boneless skinless chicken thighs</li>
        <li>Salt, duh</li>
        <li>Black pepper</li>
        <li>2 bay leaves, which are optional. I don't know many 20-somethings with bay leaves in their pantries</li>
        <li>1 cup dry white wine, but who are we kidding, keep the bottle out</li>
        <li>5 cups chicken broth</li>
        <li>2 cups Jasmine rice</li>
        <li>1 garlic head</li>
        <li>1/3 cup parsley</li>
        <li>1/2 cup (more) parmesan cheese</li>
    </ul>  
    
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Using a dutch oven or heavy bottom pot with tight fitting lid, over medium/high heat, add 1/4 cup olive oil and 2 Tbsp unsalted butter. 
            Once butter is melted and hot, stir in diced onion, grated carrots and 1 tsp salt. 
            Sautee until soft and golden (8-10 min).</li>
        <li>Add trimmed, chopped chicken thighs, 2 bay leaves, another 1 tsp salt and 1/4 tsp black pepper. 
            Saute, stirring occasionally until chicken is golden on all sides (5 mins).</li>
        <li>Increase the heat to high and add 1 cup white wine. 
            Boil down the wine, scraping the bottom until most of the wine has evaporated. <strong>IMPORTANT STEP:</strong> Drink some from the bottle while you do this.</li>
        <li>Add the hot chicken broth, then stir in the rice.</li>
        <li>Without separating the cloves (leaving the root end intact), slice the end off a whole head of garlic to expose the garlic cloves. 
            Set the whole head into the center of your rice, sliced side down. 
            Bring to a rolling boil, then reduce heat to low, cover and simmer until rice is fully cooked (15 mins).</li>
        <li>Turn off the heat, remove garlic head (you can either push the cloves of garlic out into the rice and eat it or discard it) and quickly stir in remaining 2 Tbsp butter until fully incorporated. 
            Finally, stir in chopped parsley and 1/2 cup parmesan cheese. 
            It should be creamy. 
            Serve right away or leave the lid on to keep it warm until serving. 
            Garnish with more fresh parsley to serve.</li>
    </ol>

    <h3>Note</h3>
    <p>** A note on using brown rice instead of Jasmine rice. 
        2 of my readers both tried brown rice and both said they had great results but it took 45 minutes too cook rather than 15 minutes. 
        Another reader said she tried instant brown rice and it took the same amount of time to cook as Jasmine rice.</p>
