    <!--HTML description of rice dish-->

    <p>
        <strong>Rice Dish</strong> is what I call it. I think it's actually referred to as <em>Creamy Chicken and Rice</em> but I've had it
        so many times that I called it my own thing. It's the recipe I would request as my first meal home from college each
        semester, it's the most comfort-food meal that my mom has made me, and it remains one of my favorite dishes well into adulthood.
    </p>
    <p>
        It's one pot, so all you people that hat doing dishes can rejoice, just don't let it soak too long or that cheese is going to stick.
        You can substitute things, but don't skimp on the cheese or the wine, <em>for cooking</em>. This meal will also last you the rest of the week
        if you pace yourself, which is hard with something this comforting and frankly not that healthy. Enjoy, or else!!!

        Don't you <strong>hate</strong> when recipe pages are like novels, so damn long with their stories and alternative recipe choices and whatever else
        as a means to make the most space for ads? Not this one, brutalist recipe page!
