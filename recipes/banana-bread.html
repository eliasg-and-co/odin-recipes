<!--Description of Banana Bread-->

    <p>
        Banana bread is really a clutch dish because it benefits from your laziness and inherent adversity to fruit you developed as a child. I have bananas that go bad all the time because I'll buy a bunch of 7 and I'll get them green because it gives me the time to get theough them all.
        But no, never the case, those things are brown in like 5 days. I eat fruit because I know it provides health benefits, not because I like it.
        Bananas kind of fuck with me too - like it's the only fruit that doesn't have juice, and you're lying if you're going to tell me different. I struggled for a bit when I was a kid with the consistency of bananas, but now I love them.
        In the words of former MLB player Munenori Kawasaki, <em>monkeys never cramp</em>, connecting their banana consumption to their generally healthy cramp-free bodies, and the reason Kawasaki eats three a day.

        Back to the bread, this is probably a good recipe, has good reviews, and no raisins, which absolutely do not belong in baked goods.
